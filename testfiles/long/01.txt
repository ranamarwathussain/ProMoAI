This process begins when a potential customer inquires about a product or service. Sales staff or customer support collects relevant information, provides detailed responses, and addresses any concerns or questions. If the customer is interested, they are guided through selecting the appropriate product or service. Next, the sales representative provides a quote, and after approval from the customer, the process moves to order placement. The order is then recorded in the system, and the customer receives confirmation of their order. The process ends when the order is successfully placed and confirmed.
