This process begins with monitoring inventory levels in a warehouse or store. When stock reaches a predefined threshold, an automated alert or manual check signals the need to reorder. The procurement team then places an order with suppliers, considering factors like cost, delivery time, and supplier reliability. Once the order is placed, the inventory system updates with expected delivery dates. Upon receiving the stock, it is inspected for quality, recorded in the system, and placed on shelves or in storage. The process ends when the inventory levels are updated and the restock is complete.
