This process begins with identifying an employee’s development needs or career aspirations. The manager and HR create a personal development plan, which may include training programs, mentorship, or additional responsibilities. The employee works on skill enhancement while receiving feedback and evaluation from supervisors. Once certain milestones are reached, the employee is considered for a promotion or new role. HR conducts a formal review of performance, and if approved, the promotion is finalized with new responsibilities and compensation adjustments. The process ends when the employee is promoted and transitions into the new role.
